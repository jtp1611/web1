  1 Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ,
  to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi,
  with the bishops and deacons: 2Grace be unto you, and peace,
  from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.
  3I thank my God upon every remembrance of you, 4Always
  in every prayer of mine for you all making request with joy,
  5For your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now;
